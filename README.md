# My dotfiles.

To install just run:
```bash
./debian-install.sh
```

For now install script is only written for debian, but there is no complex dependencies, so it probably will work if you just replace apt-get in debian-install.sh with your packet manager.

Features:
- session manager (run `sf` in zsh);
- dark/light theme toggle (run `:lua ToggleTheme()` in neovim).
